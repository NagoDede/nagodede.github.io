Note: For several cases, I provide the binaries and documentation files. The main objective is not to spoil work issued by other people but to maitain the tools available even if the original website disappear. This is espacially true for &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; and non updated software.

*My name is V. since my birth in the 80&amp;rsquo;s.
Why do I remain anonymous?
Simply, to live happily, let&amp;rsquo;s live hidden. Internet is full of surprises, good and bad. One of the simplest ways to protect yourself from bad surprises and to stay hidden. I argue this choice by the following analysis:
You know me in one way or another, and in this case, it is useless for me to give you this information again, Either a search engine has brought you here, in which case knowing my identity is of no immediate interest.</description></item><item><title>Eureka An old Fashion Equation Solver</title><link>https://nagodede.github.io/eureka/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Mar 2020 16:22:49 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://nagodede.github.io/eureka/</guid><description>During my studies (several years ago), I discovered the Equation solver TkSolver. Some days ago, I was trying to find a GNU equivalent to TkSolver as I wanted to perform some computations. My searches were unsuccessful (not exactly but I didn’t find a similar tool) but I found Eureka Solver which is an old solver (may be the first of this type).
Eureka Solver (and TK solver) is build on the declarative programming approach while the « standard » solvers use a procedural approach.</description></item><item><title>Japan Pilot Weather</title><link>https://nagodede.github.io/pages/japan-pilot-weather/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2020 16:22:49 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://nagodede.github.io/pages/japan-pilot-weather/</guid><description>Central Japan Weather briefing The Japan Weather Agency (JMA) provides several charts, forecasts and documents for the aeronautical operations.

I have to recognize that WordPress provides wonderful sites and an easy way to start a publication activity.
But, it uses a database, and when you want to switch to another server or a personal server, it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work and configuration. This is not the most efficient way to share data (even if there is caching, you need processor work and much electrical power to do this).</description></item><item><title>Search</title><link>https://nagodede.github.io/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nagodede.github.io/search/</guid><description>Manticore Search</description></item></channel></rss>
