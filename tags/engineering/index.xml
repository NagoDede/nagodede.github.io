*My name is V. since my birth in the 80&amp;rsquo;s.
Why do I remain anonymous?
Simply, to live happily, let&amp;rsquo;s live hidden. Internet is full of surprises, good and bad. One of the simplest ways to protect yourself from bad surprises and to stay hidden. I argue this choice by the following analysis:
You know me in one way or another, and in this case, it is useless for me to give you this information again, Either a search engine has brought you here, in which case knowing my identity is of no immediate interest.</description></item><item><title>Eureka An old Fashion Equation Solver</title><link>https://nagodede.github.io/eureka/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Mar 2020 16:22:49 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://nagodede.github.io/eureka/</guid><description>During my studies (several years ago), I discovered the Equation solver TkSolver. Some days ago, I was trying to find a GNU equivalent to TkSolver as I wanted to perform some computations. My searches were unsuccessful (not exactly but I didn’t find a similar tool) but I found Eureka Solver which is an old solver (may be the first of this type).
Eureka Solver (and TK solver) is build on the declarative programming approach while the « standard » solvers use a procedural approach.</description></item></channel></rss>
