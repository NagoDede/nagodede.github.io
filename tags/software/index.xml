Note: For several cases, I provide the binaries and documentation files. The main objective is not to spoil work issued by other people but to maitain the tools available even if the original website disappear. This is espacially true for &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; and non updated software.
If you&amp;rsquo;are the original author and don&amp;rsquo;t appreciate this pratice, please contact me.

PROP_DESIGN is open source, public domain, aircraft propeller design software. Although intended for traditional aircraft propellers, PROP_DESIGN supports:
Axial Flow Fans Counter-rotating Propellers Electric Ducted Fans - EDFs Geared Turbofans - GTFs Open Rotors Propfans Turbofans (both Rotors and Stators) Ultra-High Bypass Engines - UHBs Unducted Fans - UDFs CCBlade website: https://github.com/byuflowlab/CCBlade.jl
CCBlade is a Julia software using the blade element momentum method for propellers and turbines.</description></item><item><title>Who I am?</title><link>https://nagodede.github.io/pages/whoiam/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 13:28:58 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://nagodede.github.io/pages/whoiam/</guid><description>This page is an informal bio, my professional CV is available here.
*My name is V. since my birth in the 80&amp;rsquo;s.
Why do I remain anonymous?
Simply, to live happily, let&amp;rsquo;s live hidden. Internet is full of surprises, good and bad. One of the simplest ways to protect yourself from bad surprises and to stay hidden. I argue this choice by the following analysis:
