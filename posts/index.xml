Propeller PROP_DESIGN website: https://propdesign.jimdofree.com/
PROP_DESIGN is open source, public domain, aircraft propeller design software. Although intended for traditional aircraft propellers, PROP_DESIGN supports:
Axial Flow Fans Counter-rotating Propellers Electric Ducted Fans - EDFs Geared Turbofans - GTFs Open Rotors Propfans Turbofans (both Rotors and Stators) Ultra-High Bypass Engines - UHBs Unducted Fans - UDFs CCBlade website: https://github.com/byuflowlab/CCBlade.jl
CCBlade is a Julia software using the blade element momentum method for propellers and turbines.</description></item><item><title>Eureka An old Fashion Equation Solver</title><link>https://nagodede.github.io/eureka/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Mar 2020 16:22:49 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://nagodede.github.io/eureka/</guid><description>During my studies (several years ago), I discovered the Equation solver TkSolver. Some days ago, I was trying to find a GNU equivalent to TkSolver as I wanted to perform some computations. My searches were unsuccessful (not exactly but I didn’t find a similar tool) but I found Eureka Solver which is an old solver (may be the first of this type).
Eureka Solver (and TK solver) is build on the declarative programming approach while the « standard » solvers use a procedural approach.</description></item><item><title>Japan Pilot Weather</title><link>https://nagodede.github.io/posts/japan-pilot-weather/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2020 16:22:49 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://nagodede.github.io/posts/japan-pilot-weather/</guid><description>Central Japan Weather briefing The Japan Weather Agency (JMA) provides several charts, forecasts and documents for the aeronautical operations. Navigation inside all the documents could be difficult when you don&amp;rsquo;t know all the expressions, words and abbreviations used. Aim of the page is to present the documents, not to recall the traditional abbreviations used inside METARs, TAFs&amp;hellip;
You should be able to find the charts on this page: link: http://www.data.jma.go.jp/airinfo/index.html[jma website]</description></item></channel></rss>
