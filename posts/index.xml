My searches were unsuccessful (not exactly but I didn’t find a similar tool) but I found Eureka Solver which is an old solver (may be the first of this type).

Navigation inside all the documents could be difficult when you don&amp;rsquo;t know all the expressions, words and abbreviations used. Aim of the page is to present the documents, not to recall the traditional abbreviations used inside METARs, TAFs&amp;hellip;
You should be able to find the charts on this page: link: http://www.data.jma.go.jp/airinfo/index.html[jma website]</description></item></channel></rss>
